Ryan was nice enough to make the build easier from here.
	1. 	Clone https://github.com/cfparser/cfparser (run "mvn clean install" from your command line. 
		Make note to run it inside the root folder of the cfparser project).
	2.	Clone this repository (run "mvn clean install" from your command line. 
		Make note to run it inside the root folder of the CFLint project).
